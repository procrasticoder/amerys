                        Refractory products used by the ceramics industry to support wares during firing are generally referred to as kiln furniture. The rigorous conditions encountered in this application demand a material that resists deformation or mechanical failure during repeated heating and cooling cycles.

                        Kiln furniture pieces are damaged by cracking, bending, the accumulation of dirt and glaze or surface degradation due to oxidation or some other form of chemical attack or contamination.
